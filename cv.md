> Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste... 

Over the past ten years, I have worked in the  "altoros"  IT company as a procurement agent.

today im looking foward to improove myself in learning such an interesting shere as front end developing 
it's never too late to learn for some new things!

## Code example:
``` 
let a = prompt('what is the sum of the numbers 23 & 32?');
let b = 55;
alert(`your result: ${a} `); 
alert(`correct result: ${b}`);
